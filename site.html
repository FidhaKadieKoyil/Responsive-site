        <h2>About Seven7h Heaven</h2>
        <p>
          Food happens to us—every single day. It bumps up against everything
          else we care about: family, health, budget, schedule…and our
          happiness.
          <br /><br />
          Fellow cooks, we see you because we’re not just food editors, we are
          you. Sure, we’ve worked in publishing, restaurant kitchens, TV
          studios, grocery stores, and meal kit companies. But we’re also
          parents, dog-walkers, commuters, shoppers, homeowners—people who love
          food as much as we need it, just like you.
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p class="hidden_content">
          We are that reliable friend who cooks with you by your side, showing
          you exactly how a recipe plays out, step by step. We’re answering your
          questions. We’re here when you need a soft boiled egg, when you’re
          perfecting pilau, when you’re on a budget and throwing a party
          anyways, when you’re 11 and you need a snack, when you’ve just moved
          in with vegans, when someone gives you an Instant Pot, and when you’re
          pledging to eat less of this and more of that. We want you to be the
          first one invited to the potluck.
          <br /><br />
          Listen, we’ve been at this for a while. The Spruce Eats evolved from a
          25-year archive of recipes generated by chefs, teachers, cookbook
          writers, home cooks, food makers, and more. And all that content? It’s
          alive. We’re constantly updating and testing it. And, we’re constantly
          adding to it. We have well over 10,000 recipes. But right now you only
          need one. One that works. The one you’re looking for—maybe the one you
          didn’t even know you wanted.
          <br /><br />
          Our mission is to turn curiosity into confidence. We’re all beginners
          at something, so let's step into the kitchen and get started.
